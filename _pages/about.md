Welcome to my homepage! My full name is Duc-Minh Le, you can call me Minh 👋. I am currently an AI Engineer at Trivita AI. Previously, I was a research resident at [Qualcomm AI Research](https://www.qualcomm.com/research/artificial-intelligence) 🤖, where I had the privilege of being advised by Professor [Nhat Ho](https://nhatptnk8912.github.io/) 🏛️. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://hust.edu.vn/).

## Research Interests 


My research focuses on advancing Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, with a strong emphasis on making them scalable and efficient ⬆. I've explored exciting topics such as Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for optimizing AI models and Mixture of Experts for enhanced scalability. Additionally, I've worked on Continual Learning and remain deeply curious about new ideas and interdisciplinary research.

I'm actively seeking PhD positions in Computer Science for the upcoming academic year and excited to collaborate on impactful research! 🚀
